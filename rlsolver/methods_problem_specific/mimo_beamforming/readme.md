Quite interesting that RL finds the optimal result for the MIMO beamforming problem, which is a nonconvex optimization problem and also NP-hard.

# Reference paper 

For MIMO Beamforming problem, please refer to 

Björnson, Emil, Mats Bengtsson, and Björn Ottersten. "Optimal multiuser transmit beamforming: A difficult problem with a simple solution structure [lecture notes]." IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 31.4 (2014): 142-148.

# Welcome to discuss

For the case of N=4, K=4, and Power = 10,

Over 100 random samples,MMSE's sum rate is about 8.3.

The Branch-reduction-and-bound algorithm computes the optimal sum rate, which is 9.8.

The REINFORCEMENT learning algorithm gets 9.756. 

The following bar figure shows our results.
