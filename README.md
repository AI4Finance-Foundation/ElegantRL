ElegantRL ([website](https://elegantrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) is developed for practitioners with
the following advantages:

- **Cloud-native**: follows a cloud-native paradigm through microservice architecture and containerization, supporting [ElegantRL-Podracer](https://elegantrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/elegantrl-podracer.html) and [FinRL-Podracer](https://elegantrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/finrl-podracer.html).

- **Scalable**: fully exploits the parallelism of DRL algorithms at multiple levels, making it easily scale out to hundreds or thousands of computing nodes on a cloud platform, say, a [DGX SuperPOD platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/) with thousands of GPUs.

- **Elastic**: allows to elastically and automatically allocate computing resources on the cloud.

- **Lightweight**: the core codes <1,000 lines (check [Elegantrl_Helloworld](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/ElegantRL/tree/master/elegantrl_helloworld)).

- **Efficient**: in many testing cases (single GPU/multi-GPU/GPU cloud), we find it more efficient than [Ray RLlib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray).

- **Stable**: much much much more stable than [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) by utilizing various ensemble methods.

ElegantRL implements the following model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms:

- **DDPG, TD3, SAC, PPO, REDQ** for continuous actions,
- **DQN, Double DQN, D3QN, SAC** for discrete actions,
- **QMIX, VDN, MADDPG, MAPPO, MATD3** for multi-agent environment.

For the details of DRL algorithms, please check out the educational
webpage [OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/).

ElegantRL supports the following simulators:

- **Isaac Gym** for massively parallel simulation,
- **OpenAI Gym, MuJoCo, PyBullet, FinRL** for benchmarking.

“小雅”源于《诗经·小雅·鹤鸣》，旨在「他山之石，可以攻玉」。

For beginners, we maintain [ElegantRL-Helloworld](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/ElegantRL/tree/master/elegantrl_helloworld) as a tutorial. Its goal is to get hands-on experience with ELegantRL.

One sentence summary: an agent (_agent.py_) with Actor-Critic networks (_net.py_) is trained (_run.py_) by interacting with an environment (_env.py_).

## Experimental Demos

### More efficient than Ray RLlib

Experiments on Ant (MuJoCo), Humainoid (MuJoCo), Ant (Isaac Gym), Humanoid (Isaac Gym) # from left to right

ElegantRL fully supports Isaac Gym that runs massively parallel simulation (e.g., 4096 sub-envs) on one GPU.

### More stable than Stable-baseline 3

Experiment on Hopper-v2 # ElegantRL achieves much smaller variance (average over 8 runs).

Also, PPO+H in ElegantRL completed the training process of 5M samples about 6x faster than Stable-Baseline3.

## Testing and Contributing

Our tests are written with the built-in `unittest` Python module for easy access. In order to run a specific test file (for example, `test_training_agents.py`), use the following command from the root directory:

    python -m unittest unit_tests/test_training_agents.py

In order to run all the tests sequentially, you can use the following command:

    python -m unittest discover

Please note that some of the tests require [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) to be installed on your system. If it is not, any tests related to Isaac Gym will fail.

We welcome any contributions to the codebase, but we ask that you please **do not** submit/push code that breaks the tests. Also, please shy away from modifying the tests just to get your proposed changes to pass them. As it stands, the tests on their own are quite minimal (instantiating environments, training agents for one step, etc.), so if they're breaking, it's almost certainly a problem with your code and not with the tests.

We're actively working on refactoring and trying to make the codebase cleaner and more performant as a whole. If you'd like to help us clean up some code, we'd strongly encourage you to also watch [Uncle Bob's clean coding lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmmYSbUCWJ4x1GO839azG_BBw8rkh-zOj) if you haven't already.

    | pybullet 2.7+   | For env. We use PyBullet (free) as an alternative of MuJoCo (not free).
    | box2d-py 2.3.8  | For gym. Use pip install Box2D (instead of box2d-py)
    | matplotlib 3.2  | For plots.
